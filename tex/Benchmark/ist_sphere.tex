\subsection{Instantaneous 2D sphere}\label{sec:ist_sphere}
The domain is a unit square with gravity $\bm{g}=(0,-1)$. The fluid has constant density and viscosity ($\rho_f=1$ and $\eta_f=1$). The sphere is in the middle
of the domain with a radius R = 0.123456798 and has constant density and viscosity ($\rho_s=10^{-2}+\rho_f$ and $\eta_s=10^3 \cdot \eta_f$).\\
We distinguish three different types of velocity boundary conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item FS: free slip conditions on all sides.
\item NS: no slip conditions on all sides.
\item OT: free slip conditions on the sides and the bottom, and open boundary at the top.
\end{enumerate}

All three cases are performed for different grid resolutions, between $16 \times16$ and $512\times 512$ elements with 50 randomly distributed markers per element,
and different average schemes for the viscosity (harmonic, geometric and arithmetic). The velocity in the centre of the sphere $\bm{v}(0.5;0.5)$, minimum and
maximum velocities ($u_{min}$, $u_{max}$, $v_{min}$, $v_{max}$) and pressures ($p_{min}$, $p_{max}$), average pressure ($p_{avg}$) and root-mean-square velocity $v_{\textrm{rms}}$ (as in Eq. \ref{vrms}) on the entire domain are compared with solutions generated by ASPECT \citep{Kronbichler2012,Heister2017,Bangerth2020,Bangerth2020a}.
Results in terms of the $v_{\textrm{rms}}$ for NS model are also shown in Fig. \ref{fig:inst_sphere}.
