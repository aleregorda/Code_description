%Surface processes at the lithosphere-air interface are implemented taking into account fluvial erosion (long-range processes), hillslope processes (short-range
%processes) and failure of slopes exceeding a threshold angle $\theta$ \citep{Burov1997,Tucker1999,Sacek2012,Croissant2014,Ueda2015,Beucher2020}. Erosion rates
%$\dot{E}_{lr}$ due to long-range processes can be described by a stream power law equation \citep{Tucker1999,Ueda2015,Beucher2020}, in according to
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{E}_{lr}=K_f A^{m_e} \bm{\nabla} h^{n_e}
%\end{equation}
%where $K_f$ is the erodibility coefficient, $A$ is the upstream drainage area, $\bm{\nabla} h$ is the slope and $m_e$ and $n_e$ are parameters chosen in to
%constrain the ratio $m_e/n_e$ between 0.35 and 0.8 \citep{Croissant2014,Ueda2015,Beucher2020}. Erosion rates $\dot{E}_{sr}$ due to short-range processes are
%implemented by assuming that transport is linearly proportional to slope \citep{Burov1997,Ueda2015,Beucher2020}, in according to
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{E}_{sr}=K_d \bm{\nabla}^2 h
%\end{equation}
%where $K_d$ is the effective diffusivity. In addition, the slope is modified if it still exceeds a threshold angle after long- and short-range processes
%\citep{Ueda2015}.

%Offshore sedimentation processes are implemented similarly to hillslope processes but with a depth-dependent coefficient \citep{Sacek2012,Beucher2020}.
%The sedimentation rate $\dot{S}$ is calculated as
%\begin{equation}
%\dot{S}=K_s \bm{\nabla}^2 h
%\end{equation}
%with
%\begin{equation}
%K_s=K^*_s \exp\left(\frac{h-h_{sl}}{h_0}\right)
%\end{equation}
%where $K^*_s$ is a constant, $h_{sl}$ is the sea level and $h_0$ is a characteristic length. In case of sticky air, slope is determined by means of the markers
%chain, which is vertically corrected considering erosion and sedimentation rates. After the correction, continental markers above the markers chain are
%transformed in air markers and air markers below the markers chain become sediments. Similarly, slope is determined considering the nodes on the top boundary
%in case of true free surface and they are vertically corrected as for the markers chain. In this case, continental markers above the top boundary are simply
%deleted.
